10: 1, 2, 5, 10
15: 1, 3, 5, 15
21: 1, 3, 7, 21
28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

### [Problem 21: Amicable numbers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-1-to-100/problem-21-amicable-numbers)

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).

If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under n.

#### sumAmicableNum(1000) should return 504.

#### sumAmicableNum(2000) should return 2898.

### [Problem 22: Names scores](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-1-to-100/problem-22-names-scores)

Using names, an array defined in the background containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.

### [Problem 23: Non-abundant sums](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-1-to-100/problem-23-non-abundant-sums)

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all positive integers <= n which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0≤n≤39
. However, when n=40,402+40+41=40(40+1)+41
